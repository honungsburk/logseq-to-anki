# logseq-to-anki

A small CLI tool to convert [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) cards to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards.

It is very simple and I've made assumptions based on how my Logseq notes are structured. It may not work for you.
Luckily, it's easy to modify the code to suit your needs.
